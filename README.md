# SAS Example: Predicting Sales Using Historical Advertising Data
Project was an assignment completed for the class MIS543 - Enterprise Performance Management as part of my coursework for the Masters in Data Analytics program at [CSU-Global](https://csuglobal.edu/graduate/masters-degrees/data-analytics).

This project was completed using the free [SAS University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html). 

The example uses data for sales of a single product which was advertised using different mediums over the period of twenty months. The goal was to predict which advertising method: point of sale, radio, television, or newspaper, had the greatest correlation with increased sales. 

## STEP 1: IMPORT DATA

## STEP 2: EXPLORE DATA

## STEP 3: IDENTIFY CORRELATIONS 

## STEP 4: PERFROM MULTIPLE REGRESSION

## STEP 5: CREATE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL 

First, descriptive statistics and plots were produced to understand the characteristics of each variable within the dataset. Second, correlation analysis was performed to identify the direction and strength of the linear relationships between each type of advertising medium and sales. Third, regression analysis was performed for the variables with had linear relationships with sales. Finally a regression equation was constructed from the model results which could be used to predict future sales based on different independent variable values.
